    "# Proposition Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements Python code to apply a large language model (LLM) to the tasks of first generating a research/analysis plan and second executing that plan to generate an analysis report.\n",
    "The key input is a proposition -- a statement or question -- that is to be researched.\n",
    "The output is an R Markdown text file containing the report capturing the results and summarization of the research.\n",

    "As the plan, a query graph is created consisting of Query nodes. Some of the nodes pose a question to the LLM, while others first pose a search query to the Serper Google Search API in order to gather current information, and then use the search results as the context for the question it poses to the LLM."

    "This notebook began as a quick test of the `instructor` package by Jason Liu ([Instructor Documentation](https://jxnl.github.io/instructor)).  It's strengths are the following:\n",

    "* Can query an LLM based off a class object (i.e., the `response_model` argument) without even having to write a custom system prompt.\n",

    "print('What are the functional roles of the ingredients in a commercially manufactured salad dressing?\\nContext: {\"responses\":[{\"query\":\"What is the functional role of emulsifiers in salad dressing?\",\"response\":\"The functional role of emulsifiers in salad dressing is to stabilize and maintain the emulsion between oil and water-based ingredients. Salad dressings typically consist of oil, vinegar or other acidic ingredients, and water-based ingredients like herbs, spices, and flavorings. Since oil and water do not naturally mix, emulsifiers are added to prevent separation and create a smooth and uniform texture.\\\\n\\\\nEmulsifiers work by reducing the surface tension between oil and water, allowing them to mix together more easily. They form a protective layer around the oil droplets, preventing them from coalescing and separating from the water-based ingredients. This helps to create a stable and homogeneous mixture, ensuring that the dressing remains well-blended and does not separate over time.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, emulsifiers can enhance the mouthfeel and texture of salad dressings by providing a creamy and smooth consistency. They can also improve the overall sensory experience by enhancing flavor release and preventing the formation of undesirable textures, such as oiliness or grittiness.\\\\n\\\\nCommon emulsifiers used in salad dressings include lecithin, which is derived from soybeans or egg yolks, and xanthan gum, a natural thickening agent. These emulsifiers help to create a visually appealing and palatable salad dressing that is easy to pour, spread, and mix with salad ingredients.\"},{\"query\":\"What is the functional role of preservatives in salad dressing?\",\"response\":\"The functional role of preservatives in salad dressing is to inhibit the growth of microorganisms, such as bacteria, yeast, and mold, thereby extending the shelf life of the product. Preservatives help maintain the freshness, quality, and safety of the salad dressing by preventing spoilage and the growth of harmful bacteria that could cause foodborne illnesses. They also help preserve the flavor, texture, and appearance of the dressing over time.\"},{\"query\":\"What is the functional role of flavor enhancers in salad dressing?\",\"response\":\"The functional role of flavor enhancers in salad dressing is to enhance and intensify the taste and aroma of the dressing. Flavor enhancers are typically added to salad dressings to improve the overall flavor profile, making them more appealing and enjoyable to consume. They work by stimulating the taste buds and enhancing the perception of flavors, making the dressing more flavorful and satisfying. Flavor enhancers can include ingredients such as monosodium glutamate (MSG), yeast extracts, natural or artificial flavorings, herbs, spices, or other flavor-enhancing compounds.\"},{\"query\":\"What is the functional role of thickeners in salad dressing?\",\"response\":\"Thickeners play a crucial functional role in salad dressings by providing the desired texture and consistency. They help to create a smooth and creamy texture, preventing the dressing from separating or becoming watery. Thickeners also enhance the mouthfeel of the dressing, giving it a more luxurious and satisfying feel when consumed. Additionally, they help to suspend and distribute the various ingredients evenly throughout the dressing, ensuring a consistent flavor and appearance.\"},{\"query\":\"What is the functional role of acids in salad dressing?\",\"response\":\"Acids play several functional roles in salad dressing:\\\\n\\\\n1. Flavor enhancement: Acids, such as vinegar or citrus juices, add a tangy and refreshing taste to salad dressings. They help balance the flavors by providing a contrast to the richness of oils and other ingredients.\\\\n\\\\n2. pH adjustment: Acids help in adjusting the pH of the dressing. Most salad dressings are slightly acidic, which helps to inhibit the growth of bacteria and increase the shelf life of the dressing.\\\\n\\\\n3. Emulsification: Acids aid in the emulsification process, which is the process of combining oil and water-based ingredients to create a stable and homogeneous mixture. The acid helps to break down the oil into smaller droplets, allowing it to mix more easily with other ingredients.\\\\n\\\\n4. Tenderizing: Some acids, like lemon juice or vinegar, can help tenderize certain ingredients in the salad, such as raw vegetables or proteins. The acid breaks down the fibers and proteins, making them more tender and easier to eat.\\\\n\\\\n5. Preservation: Acids act as natural preservatives by inhibiting the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms. They create an environment that is less favorable for spoilage, thus extending the shelf life of the salad dressing.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, acids in salad dressing contribute to the taste, texture, preservation, and overall quality of the dressing.\"},{\"query\":\"What is the functional role of colorants in salad dressing?\",\"response\":\"The functional role of colorants in salad dressing is to enhance the visual appeal of the product. Colorants are added to give the dressing an attractive and appetizing appearance, making it more visually appealing to consumers. This can help in attracting attention and influencing purchasing decisions. Colorants are used to achieve a desired color or shade that is visually appealing and consistent with the flavor or type of dressing. Additionally, colorants can also be used to differentiate between different varieties or flavors of salad dressings.\"}]}')\n",

    "    A major inference task in Bayesian networks is explaining why some variables are observed in their particular states using a set of target variables. \n",
    "    Existing methods for solving this problem often generate explanations that are either too simple (underspecified) or too complex (overspecified). In this paper, \n",
    "    we introduce a method called Most Relevant Explanation (MRE) which finds a partial instantiation of the target variables that maximizes the generalized Bayes factor (GBF) \n",
    "    as the best explanation for the given evidence. Our study shows that GBF has several theoretical properties that enable MRE to automatically identify the most relevant \n",
    "    target variables in forming its explanation. In particular, conditional Bayes factor (CBF), defined as the GBF of a new explanation conditioned on an existing explanation, \n",
    "    provides a soft measure on the degree of relevance of the variables in the new explanation in explaining the evidence given the existing explanation. As a result, \n",
    "    MRE is able to automatically prune less relevant variables from its explanation. We also show that CBF is able to capture well the explaining-away phenomenon that is often \n",
    "    represented in Bayesian networks. Moreover, we define two dominance relations between the candidate solutions and use the relations to generalize MRE to find a set of \n",
    "    top explanations that is both diverse and representative. Case studies on several benchmark diagnostic Bayesian networks show that MRE is often able to find explanatory hypotheses \n",

It is a non-parametric technique that can adaptively determine the optimal binning of data by maximizing a fitness function that is based on a Bayesian prior and likelihood. The method is often used in the analysis of astronomical data, but it can be applied to any type of data that is amenable to histogram representation.\\n\\nThe connection to dynamic programming comes from the algorithm's approach to optimizing the binning. Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, solving each of these subproblems just once, and storing their solutions - ideally, using a recursive relation. The key feature of dynamic programming is the use of these stored solutions to solve larger subproblems, which avoids the need to recompute the answers to the subproblems multiple times.\\n\\nIn the context of Bayesian blocks, dynamic programming is used to efficiently find the optimal segmentation of the data into blocks (bins). The algorithm iteratively evaluates the fitness of different possible partitions of the data, storing the best solution found for each segment. By building on these solutions, the algorithm can efficiently find the best overall partitioning of the data into blocks.\\n\\nFor literature references, here are some sources that discuss Bayesian blocks and dynamic programming:\\n\\n1.

The goal of BO is to find the maximum (or minimum) of an objective function efficiently, which means with as few evaluations as possible. This is achieved by building a probabilistic model of the objective function and using it to make decisions about where to sample next.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step logical reasoning on how Bayesian Optimization can be applied to experimental design, along with literature references:\\n\\n1. **Define the Objective Function**: In experimental design, the objective function typically represents the outcome of an experiment that depends on certain input parameters. The function is often unknown or partially known, and direct evaluations are expensive (e.g., time, resources).\\n\\n2. **Choose a Prior**: Bayesian Optimization starts with a prior over the objective function, which captures beliefs about the behavior of the function before any data is collected. Gaussian Processes (GPs) are commonly used as priors due to their flexibility and tractability (Rasmussen & Williams, 2006, \\\"Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning\\\").\\n\\n3. **Acquire Data**: Initial data is collected, often through a small number of random experiments, to update the prior and create a posterior distribution.\\n\\n4. **Update the Model**: The GP model is updated with the new data, which involves computing the posterior distribution of the function's values at new points given the observed data.\\n\\n5. **Select Next Sample Point**: A new sample point is chosen by optimizing an acquisition function, which balances exploration (sampling where the model is uncertain) and exploitation (sampling where the model predicts high values). Common acquisition functions include Expected Improvement, Probability of Improvement, and Upper Confidence Bound.\\n\\n6. **Iterate**: Steps 3-5 are repeated, each time updating the model with the new data, until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations, convergence of the objective function value, or exhaustion of resources).\\n\\n7. **Make Decisions**: The results of Bayesian Optimization can inform decisions about the experimental design, such as the optimal settings of the experimental parameters.\\n\\nLiterature references that discuss Bayesian Optimization in the context of experimental design include:\\n\\n- Shahriari, B., Swersky, K., Wang, Z., Adams, R.

Good and Alan Turing during World War II for cryptanalysis purposes. It has since been widely used in various fields, such as ecology, linguistics, and information theory, for estimating the probability of encountering an unseen event given a set of observed data. The method is particularly useful when dealing with sparse data.\\n\\nThe Good-Turing estimator adjusts the observed frequencies of events to better estimate the true frequencies, including those events that have not been observed (i.e., have zero frequency in the sample). The key idea is to reassign some of the probability mass from observed to unobserved events.\\n\\nFrom a Bayesian perspective, the Good-Turing estimation can be derived by considering a nonparametric Bayesian model. In such a model, one assumes a prior distribution over the possible frequencies of different events, and then updates this distribution in light of the observed data. The Good-Turing estimate can be seen as an approximation to the Bayesian posterior predictive distribution of the frequency of an unobserved event.\\n\\nThe literature references provided in the context suggest that there has been work on rediscovering Good-Turing estimators through Bayesian nonparametrics. For example, the paper titled \\\"Rediscovery of Good–Turing estimators via Bayesian Nonparametrics\\\" investigates the relationship between the Good-Turing approach and Bayesian nonparametric methods. This paper can be found on JSTOR (https://www.jstor.org/stable/24738771), PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26224325/), arXiv (https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0303), and the Oxford Academic website (https://academic.oup.com/biometrics/article/72/1/136/7511697).\\n\\nThe Bayesian nonparametric approach typically involves using Dirichlet Process or Pitman-Yor Process priors, which allow for an infinite number of possible events (species, words, etc.). The Good-Turing estimator can be derived as a special case or approximation within these Bayesian nonparametric frameworks.\\n\\nTo summarize, the Good-Turing estimation can be connected to Bayesian principles by considering it as an approximation to the Bayesian posterior predictive distribution for unseen events, derived within a nonparametric Bayesian framework. The literature references provided offer a deeper exploration of this connection and the mathematical derivations involved.\"},{\"task_id\":\"kalman_filters\",\"query\":\"Explore Kalman filters and smoothing with respect to derivation from Bayesian principles and as an example of dynamic programming and cite literature references.\\n\",\"response\":\"Kalman filters are a class of filters that are used for estimating the state of a dynamic system over time. They are based on Bayesian principles and can be seen as an example of dynamic programming. Here's a step-by-step logical reasoning that connects Kalman filters to Bayesian principles and dynamic programming, along with literature references:\\n\\n1. **Bayesian Principles:**\\n   - Kalman filters operate on the Bayesian principle of recursive estimation. At each time step, the filter takes a prediction of the system's state and updates it with new measurement data to produce a posterior estimate.\\n   - The prediction step is based on a prior model of the system's evolution, while the update step incorporates new data using Bayes' theorem to revise the belief about the system's state.\\n   - The Kalman filter assumes that both the system dynamics and the measurements are subject to Gaussian noise, which allows for closed-form expressions for the prediction and update steps.\\n\\n   **Literature Reference:**\\n   - \\\"Kalman filter demystified: from intuition to probabilistic graphical models\\\" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11618) provides an intuitive explanation of the Kalman filter from a Bayesian perspective.\\n\\n2. **Dynamic Programming:**\\n   - Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.\\n   - The Kalman filter can be seen as an example of dynamic programming because it solves the filtering problem in a recursive manner. Each step of the filter computes an optimal estimate of the current state based on the previous estimate and the latest measurement, which is analogous to the principle of optimality in dynamic programming.\\n\\n   **Literature Reference:**\\n   - \\\"The Kalman Filter and Related Algorithms: A Literature Review\\\" (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236897001_The_Kalman_Filter_and_Related_Algorithms_A_Literature_Review) discusses the Kalman filter in the context of various algorithms, which can be related to dynamic programming.\\n\\n3. **Kalman Smoothing:**\\n   - Kalman smoothing refers to the process of improving the state estimates obtained by a Kalman filter by incorporating future measurements. This is typically done in a batch process, where the entire sequence of measurements is processed to refine the state estimates.\\n   - Smoothing can also be derived from Bayesian principles, as it involves computing the posterior distribution of the state over the entire time series of measurements.\\n\\n   **Literature Reference:**\\n   - \\\"BAYESIAN FILTERING AND SMOOTHING\\\" (https://users.aalto.fi/~ssarkka/pub/cup_book_online_20131111.pdf) provides an introduction to non-linear Kalman filtering and smoothing from a Bayesian perspective.\\n\\n4. **Further Reading:**\\n   - For a comprehensive understanding of the Kalman filter's derivation from Bayesian principles, \\\"Advanced Kalman Filtering Approaches to Bayesian State Estimation\\\" (https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1077486/FULLTEXT01.pdf) can be a valuable resource.\\n   - The Wikipedia page on Kalman filters (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter) provides a broad overview and links to various extensions of the Kalman filter, which can be useful for understanding its relationship to Bayesian principles and dynamic programming.\\n\\nIn summary, Kalman filters are deeply rooted in Bayesian principles, using prior knowledge and observed data to make inferences about the state of a system. The recursive nature of the Kalman filter aligns with the principles of dynamic programming, where each step optimizes the state estimate based on the previous step and new information. The literature provided offers a detailed exploration of these concepts.\"},{\"task_id\":\"optimal_stopping_rules\",\"query\":\"Explore optimal stopping rules with respect to derivation from Bayesian principles and as an example of dynamic programming and cite literature references.\\n\",\"response\":\"Optimal stopping rules are a fundamental concept in decision theory and statistics, particularly in the context of sequential analysis and dynamic programming. The goal of an optimal stopping rule is to determine the best time to take a particular action to maximize an expected payoff or to minimize an expected cost, based on sequentially observed random variables.\\n\\nFrom a Bayesian perspective, optimal stopping involves updating beliefs about an uncertain process as new information becomes available and making a decision about when to stop based on these updated beliefs. Bayesian principles provide a framework for incorporating prior knowledge and evidence into the decision-making process.\\n\\nDynamic programming, on the other hand, is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is particularly useful in the context of optimal stopping because it allows for the problem to be solved recursively, considering the value of stopping at each point in time versus the expected value of continuing and making a decision later.\\n\\nLet's explore some literature references that discuss optimal stopping rules, Bayesian principles, and dynamic programming:\\n\\n1. \\\"Optimal Stopping and Applications\\\" by Thomas S.

Particle filters, also known as Sequential Monte Carlo methods, are a popular choice for solving the SLAM problem due to their ability to handle non-linear models and non-Gaussian noise.\\n\\nThe particle filter approach to SLAM is derived from Bayesian principles, which provide a probabilistic framework for state estimation. In Bayesian terms, the goal is to compute the posterior distribution of the robot's path and the map given all the available data (sensor measurements and control inputs). The particle filter approximates this posterior distribution using a set of particles, where each particle represents a hypothesis of the robot's trajectory and the map.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step logical reasoning of how particle filters are derived from Bayesian principles in the context of SLAM:\\n\\n1. **Bayesian Filtering**: The foundation of particle filters lies in Bayesian filtering, which updates the belief about the state of a system as new data becomes available. The belief is represented as a probability distribution over possible states.\\n\\n2. **Recursive Estimation**: Bayesian filtering is recursive and consists of two main steps: prediction and update. The prediction step uses the system model to propagate the belief over time, while the update step incorporates new measurements to refine the belief.\\n\\n3. **Non-parametric Representation**: Particle filters use a non-parametric representation of the probability distribution, which means they do not assume any specific form (like Gaussian) for the distribution. Instead, they represent the distribution as a set of samples (particles).\\n\\n4. **Importance Sampling**: Particle filters employ importance sampling to approximate the posterior distribution. Each particle is drawn from a proposal distribution and is assigned a weight based on how well it explains the observed data.\\n\\n5. **Resampling**: To avoid the problem of degeneracy, where all but a few particles have negligible weight, particle filters periodically perform resampling. This process generates a new set of particles by sampling with replacement from the current set, biased towards particles with higher weights.\\n\\n6. **Rao-Blackwellization**: In the context of SLAM, particle filters can be combined with Rao-Blackwellization to reduce variance and computational cost. This technique analytically computes the conditional distribution of the map given the trajectory, which is represented by the particles.\\n\\nThe literature provides extensive coverage of these principles and their application to SLAM:\\n\\n- Thrun, S.

Good, and connection to mutual information by expectation (averaging) and cite literature references.\\n\",\"response\":\"The concept of \\\"Weight of Evidence\\\" (WoE) in hypothesis confirmation is a measure of how much a piece of evidence supports or contradicts a hypothesis. It was extensively discussed by the British statistician I.J. Good, who contributed significantly to Bayesian statistics and the philosophy of probability.\\n\\nIn Good's framework, the weight of evidence is often quantified as the logarithm of the likelihood ratio. If we have two hypotheses, H1 and H2, and evidence E, the weight of evidence provided by E in favor of H1 over H2 is given by:\\n\\nWoE = log(P(E|H1)/P(E|H2))\\n\\nwhere P(E|H1) is the probability of observing the evidence E given that hypothesis H1 is true, and P(E|H2) is the probability of observing E given that H2 is true.\\n\\nThis concept is closely related to mutual information, which in information theory is a measure of the amount of information that one random variable contains about another random variable. Mutual information can be seen as an expectation (average) of the weight of evidence that an observation provides about the state of the world.\\n\\nThe connection between weight of evidence and mutual information can be understood through the lens of Bayesian inference. Mutual information quantifies the reduction in uncertainty (or increase in certainty) about one random variable due to the knowledge of another. In the context of hypothesis testing, mutual information can be seen as the expected weight of evidence across all possible observations.\\n\\nFor literature references, you can look at the following sources:\\n\\n1.
